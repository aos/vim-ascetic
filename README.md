### vim-ascetic

I wanted a monochrome dark (n)vim colorscheme that used a transparent
background and/or with softer tones. Too many of them used bolds and bright
whites. Apparently that's not a thing, so I made this.

Still WIP as I tweak the colors for non-`termguicolors`, but I'm using it from now on.
